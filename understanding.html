		<h2>Understanding Accessibility</h2>
		<div class="understanding_accessibility">
			<div class="understanding_1">
				<img src = "images/accessibility.jpg" alt="Types of accessibility" width="200"/>
				<p>Accessibility is the concept of whether a product or service can be used by everyone—however they encounter it. Accessibility laws exist to aid people with disabilities, but designers should try to accommodate all potential users in many contexts of use anyway. To do so has firm benefits—notably better designs for all.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="understanding_2">
				<img src = "images/web_accessibility.png" alt="Web accessibility design" width="200"/>
				<p>Accessibility is not confined to a group of users with some different abilities, for example, visual, motor, auditory, speech, or cognitive disabilities, rather it extends to anyone who is experiencing any permanent, temporary or situational disability, e.g., having only one arm is a permanent condition, having an injured arm is a temporary, and holding a baby in one arm is situational — in each case the user is able to complete tasks with only one hand.</p>

		<h2>Accessibility Design Guidelines</h2>
		<div class="understanding_guidelines">
			<div class="understanding_3_main">
				<img src = "images/guidelines.jpeg" alt="Guidelines" width="200"/>
				<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) stipulates standards for accessible design in its latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We can follow these essential points to accommodate users with diverse abilities:</p>
		    </div>
			<div class="understanding_3_bullet">
				<p class="bullet"> - Use a content management system (CMS) supporting accessibility standards (e.g., WordPress). Whenever you amend any pre-used template, ensure themes were designed for accessibility.</p>
				<p class="bullet"> - Include personas with varying abilities.</p>
				<p class="bullet"> - Use header tags in text (optimally, use CSS for consistency throughout). Move consecutively from one heading level to the next (without skipping).</p>
